## PropertyLink

Visit the live demo here.

A basic web app for property managers. A user can create an account and add/maintain properties with linked tenants and tenancy details.

## Motivation

This app was developed to strengthen my recent learnings in building backend CRUD systems, integrating gem API's, using front-end frameworks, and finally, deployment to a server.

## Screenshots

Include logo/demo screenshot etc.

## Tech/framework used

<b>Built with</b>

- Ruby on Rails
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap v5

## Features

- Basic user authentication (bcrypt) and cookie sessions

- The Geocoder Ruby gem (see more here) automatically populates latitude and longitude columns in the associated properties table based on address data filled by the user.

- The Google Maps Embed API was used to depict street-view based on the longitude/latitude values. Given the public nature of git commits, the API key was set as an environment variable in Heroku to obscure the key.

## Installation

Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.
